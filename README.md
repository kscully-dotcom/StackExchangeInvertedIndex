# StackExchangeInvertedIndex
This is an inverted index of PostID, Tags, Scores, and ClosedDates queried from StackExchange, 
run through PySpark,
report written in Jupyter Notebooks 
via VM on AWS EMR.

Update 3/3/2022 - I initially chose GCP GCloud but there were many bugs. I decided to shift my work over to AWS EMR.
